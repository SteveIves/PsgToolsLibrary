;Title:		winerror.def
;
;Notes:		This file contains most of the error definitions for the Win32 API
;			routines.  In the WIN-32 API, error constants are preceeded with
;			ERROR_ , whereas in this file they are prexeeded with W32_ . The
;			reason for this was to make the error codes more recognizable as
;			WIN32 errors, but also to shorten the length of some of the identifiers
;			to within the 30 characters supported by Synergy.  The identifiers
;			which are still over 30 characters have been temporarily commented out
;			of this file.
